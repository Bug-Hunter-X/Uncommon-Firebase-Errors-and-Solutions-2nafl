# Uncommon Firebase Errors and Solutions
This repository demonstrates some less-common errors encountered when working with the Firebase Realtime Database and provides solutions to address them.

**Error 1: Data Structure Mismatch**
This occurs when you access a database field that doesn't exist or has an unexpected data type.

**Error 2: Type Mismatch**
Attempting to write data of an incorrect type (e.g., string to a numeric field) can cause errors.

**Error 3: Asynchronous Operation Handling**
Improper handling of asynchronous operations can lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code illustrating these errors, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` shows how to fix them.
