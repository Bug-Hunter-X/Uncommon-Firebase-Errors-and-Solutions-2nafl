The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data in your database doesn't match the structure you expect. For example, if you try to access a field that doesn't exist, you'll get an error.  Another common error happens when you attempt to write data that's not in the expected format (e.g., trying to write a string into a numeric field).  Incorrectly handling asynchronous operations (promises or async/await) can also lead to unexpected behaviour and silent errors, particularly when dealing with data updates.
